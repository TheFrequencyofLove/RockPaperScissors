# Rock Paper Scissors game.

In this website I created 3 functions. A random number generator function, a winorlose function, and a message function.

The random number generator function randomly chooses rock paper or scissors and returns it as cpuChoice.

Then the winorlose function takes the userChoice and the cpuChoice and decides wether
the result will be a win loss or tie. Then returns result.

Then the message function creates of message based on the userchoice, cpuchoice and winorlose result. 

When the one of the buttons is pressed it sets the userChoice to that button and calls the functions. Then gives alert with message generated.
